# This is the Final Code

(To be implemented after checking all equipments)

After feeding the code to Arduino using the IDE, 

**Connections:** üîå
- Arduino to the 9V Battery using connector
- Buzzer positive to pin 8 on board 
- Buzzer negative to GND on board _(via breadboard)_
- VCC of moisture sensor to 5V on board _(via breadboard)_
- GND of moisture sensor to GND on board _(via breadboard)_
- A0 of moisture sensor to A0 on board 
- Pump negative to Collector of Transistor
- Transistor base to Pin 3 on board
- Emitter pin to GND on board
- Pump positive to Battery Positive
- Battery Negative to GND on board _(via breadboard)_
- VCC of water level sensor to 5V on board _(via breadboard)_
- GND of water level sensor to GND on board _(via breadboard)_
- SIG of water level sensor to A5 on board
- Pipe with Pump leading to the Plant

## **The Setup:** üèµÔ∏è

Otherwise, it'll check for moisture and water level every 30mins, and provide the water via drip irrigation due to small apertures in the plastic pipe.

The pipe is fixed at a place using cello-tape to prevent spillage.

```Note: If small holes are made to provide drip irrigation, it'll lead to better results```
