# Plantector

## What is Plantector?
It is a solution for protecting plants from dying due to over-flooding or drying up.

## Inspiration

I was entering adulthood, so thought of growing a few plants. So, I bought a small dog-flower plant.

It lived for a few weeks, but then suddenly one day it started drooping. I thought it was low on water so I watered, but then it died. Later on searching got to know it was due to the excess water.

Similarly, plants I got before died due to drying up. This made me sad and so I thought of doing something about it, and _**VOILA!**_

## The Project : Plantector

### Procedure

Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) on your Computer. [Do check your PC's Compatibility]

Once you have gotten all the things, I'd recommend you to test it all before going ahead with all of it.

For testing, go to the [Test Codes](https://github.com/Achyut-Saxena/Plantector/tree/main/Codes/Test%20Codes). All expected output's are given in [Test Codes](https://github.com/Achyut-Saxena/Plantector/tree/main/Codes/Test%20Codes), in case it doesn't match check the connections as well as the equipment.

Once you are sure that everything is working, go ahead with your **VERY FIRST PROTOTYPE!!**

Navigate to [Final](https://github.com/Achyut-Saxena/Plantector/tree/main/Codes/Final). You'll find the final code along with the circuit diagram and the expected result in the README of [Final](https://github.com/Achyut-Saxena/Plantector/tree/main/Codes/Final).

Hope you try it out, and use your skills to solve a very minor problem at many households without purchasing a product and rather making it yourself.

## Important Notes:

- Do study the plant you have before blindly copying the code, ask the florist about the water, sunlight and fertilisesr requirements. Then code accordingly.
- Check for any loose connections or any issue with casings, as it might lead to corrosion and contamination of water in reservoir as well.
